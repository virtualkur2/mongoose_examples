# mongoose_examples

A mongoose examples repository to test out some features and a 'how to' solve common problems.

This idea was born because I'm a collaborator on Stack Overflow (spanish mainly) and someone ask [this](https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/237695/uso-de-populate-con-mongoose-referenciando-a-indices-hijos-de-un-document) question.


**BASIC USAGE**

Simply clone the repository, and run `npm --install` to install dependencies.

You need a MongoDB database up and running locally in the default port (27017). The solution was tested with MongoDB version v4.0.6.


**Populate method example**

This example creates a basic Express Server with a few API endpoints.

To run this example, after cloning and install dependencies, run this command: `npm run populate`
